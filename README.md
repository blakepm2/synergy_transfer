# ðŸ§¬ Synergy Transfer

**Synergy Transfer** is a deep learning model that can predict synergies between various drugs to aid in cancer research.

> ![NOTE]
> This project is an attempt to reproduce the results from the paper **"Anti-Cancer Drug Synergy Prediction in Understudied Tissues Using Transfer Learning"** by [Kim et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.05.932657). Most of the original code has been reused, with only necessary modifications made to resolve dependency issues and perform ablation studies.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

A significant challenge faced in the drug discovery for cancer research is the uneven distribution of data for particular types of cancers and tissues. [Kim et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.05.932657) present a novel solution using a deep neural network that uses transfer learning to learn from the abundance of examples within data-rich tissues and enhance predictions in data-poor tissues.
