# ðŸ§¬ Synergy Transfer

**Synergy Transfer** is a deep learning model that can predict synergies between various drugs to aid in cancer research.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is an attempt to reproduce the results from the paper **"Anti-Cancer Drug Synergy Prediction in Understudied Tissues Using Transfer Learning"** by [Kim et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.05.932657). Most of the original code has been reused, with only necessary modifications made to resolve dependency issues and perform ablation studies. 

The original publication can be accessed [here](https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article-abstract/28/1/42/5920819?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false). And the original publication GitHub repoitory can be accessed [here](https://github.com/yejinjkim/synergy-transfer). 

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

A significant challenge faced in the drug discovery for cancer research is the uneven distribution of data for particular types of cancers and tissues. [Kim et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.05.932657) present a novel solution using a deep neural network that uses transfer learning to learn from the abundance of examples within data-rich tissues and enhance predictions in data-poor tissues.
